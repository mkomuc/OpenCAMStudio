//! User preferences — the per-user settings file.
//!
//! **Deliberately outside the `gui` module.** `cam-app` builds and tests *without*
//! the `gui` feature by default, so anything living in `gui.rs` is invisible to the
//! default test run — and the rules worth testing here (clamping, defaults, what
//! happens to a file we cannot read) are exactly the kind that go unnoticed for
//! months otherwise. Same reasoning that moved `ToolKindPick` and
//! `origin_move_targets` out.
//!
//! # What is a preference
//!
//! Something about **how you work**, or about **your hardware**. Never about *this
//! part*. Three exclusions follow from that and are settled (Andreas, 2026-08-01):
//!
//! - **No cutting parameters** — stepover, feeds, plunge style are a tool-library
//!   matter. Per-tool nominal cutting data already seeds a new operation; a second
//!   default here would be a competing source of truth, and the two would drift with
//!   no way for the operator to tell which produced the number in front of them.
//! - **No default machine** — only the post ([`NewProjectPrefs`]). The machine
//!   *gates* an export (envelope, feed/spindle ceilings) and is saved per project at
//!   schema v11 precisely so reopening a job cannot silently retarget it.
//! - **No units (mm/inch)** — that reaches every field, every golden, the `.ocam`
//!   format and every post. Its own milestone if ever wanted, never a checkbox.
//!
//! The inverse is the strongest argument *for* the file: several values here are not
//! preferences of taste but of **hardware**. The pane minimums were tuned on one
//! monitor, and a value chosen on one display is a bug on another (see
//! [`PanePrefs`]).
