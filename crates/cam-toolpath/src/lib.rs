//! # cam-toolpath — strategies that turn geometry into CL-data
//!
//! A **strategy** consumes model geometry (via `cam-geo`) and emits controller-
//! neutral [`Program`](cam_cldata::Program) motions. Strategies are the left-hand
//! plugin kind of the hourglass; posts are the right.
//!
//! ## Design rules honoured here
//!
//! - **Pure & cancellable.** [`Strategy::compute`] is a pure function of its
//!   inputs — no I/O, no globals, deterministic — so it is trivially testable and
//!   `cam-app` can run it as a cancellable background task via a [`CancelToken`].
//! - **Diagnostics, not panics.** A strategy never panics on bad input; it
//!   returns a [`StrategyResult`] carrying whatever motions it could produce plus
//!   typed [`Diagnostic`]s (errors and warnings).
//! - **ABI-friendly seam.** Only plain data crosses [`Strategy::compute`]
//!   ([`JobEnv`] in, [`StrategyResult`] out), so extracting the trait into a
//!   `cdylib` plugin ABI later is cheap.
